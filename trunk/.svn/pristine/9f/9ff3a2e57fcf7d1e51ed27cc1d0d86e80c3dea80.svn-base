Flattened DocBook plus CSSa. 

See [the XML Prague 2013 presentation](https://archive.xmlprague.cz/2013/presentations/Conveying_Layout_Information_with_CSSa/CSSa_xmlprague_gimsieke.html).

The unaltered DocBook Publishers V5.1CR1-1 RNG schema is included here (might have included DocBook as a submodule but didnâ€™t find docbook.rng in its repo).

CSSa is included as a submodule from https://github.com/le-tex/CSSa

SVG 1.1 (rng files from http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/rng/) modifications: 
 
 * Removed relaxng.dtd references
 * define and ref elements of 'set' and 'image': replaced with 'svg-set' and 'svg-image'
